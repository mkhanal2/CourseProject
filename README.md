#How to use/run the code
The code is developed using python 3 (Jupiter notebook). There is folder called source_code on the GitHub (https://github.com/mkhanal2/CourseProject) where we put all the documentation and source-code for the project. Follow following instruction to run the code:
•	Download the folder “source_code” from GitHub (link above)
•	Makes sure you have folder called “data” under source_code folder which has (train.jsonl, test.jsonl and glove.twitter.27B.25d.txt) , all of these files and folder are already in GitHub.
•	Now open Jupiter Notebook on you laptop (usually within Anaconda).
•	Using Jupiter Notebook open the source code from the downloaded folder (source code file name: Project Source Code.ipynb)
•	After that you can run the code. Please make sure that all the packages used in the 2nd cell of the notebook are already installed. I have provided the instruction on 1st cell of the notebook on how to install the packages.
